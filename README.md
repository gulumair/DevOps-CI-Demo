Here's a rewritten version of the DevOps CI Demo overview, keeping the context and information the same but aiming for a slightly clearer and more concise presentation:

# Continuous Integration Demo with GitHub Actions ðŸš€

This project provides a straightforward demonstration of a **Continuous Integration (CI)** pipeline using **GitHub Actions**.

### Project Summary
The core of the project is a simple **Node.js** script designed to output the string `"Hello CI from Node.js!"`. A **Jest** unit test is included to verify this specific output.

---

### CI Pipeline Overview
The CI workflow, built with **GitHub Actions**, is automatically initiated whenever a **Pull Request (PR)** is opened or updated against the repository. The workflow's primary function is to **execute all tests** (`npm test`), ensuring that the project remains functional and that all checks pass *before* any code can be merged into the main branch.

---

### Key Commands
To work with this project locally:

* **Install Dependencies:** `npm install`
* **Run Tests:** `npm test`
---

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI pipeline is triggered automatically on every Pull Request creation or update, ensuring that all tests pass before merging.
